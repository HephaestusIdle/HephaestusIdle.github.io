#Stuff to fix
* Combat
    - Zone Clears in odd way, should be green on kill?
* UI
    - SlideInOut/foreGround left side stuff requires rearranging on hide
        + Create a SlideInOutManager
        + also useful for dungeons controling
    - RadioGroupButton 1st button doesn't work
* MercenaryList.js after time is up, open and closing window always changes the mercs
